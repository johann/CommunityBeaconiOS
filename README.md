CommunityBeaconiOS
==================

iBeacon based app 
This app will be used to scan beacons around campus and push info on events/notifications to students

To build this app I will be using several Cocoapods and any other open source projects to add to the functionability of my app

Cocoapods - Used

Pulsing Halo - Beacon View
TwitterCover
TGLStackedView

I'm still deciding how to display my view. The stacked passbookesque view is very nice so I'm leaning towards that direction
